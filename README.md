# Lession Introduction to Deep learning with Pytorch. 

**Abstract.** This repo is our work of [Deep Learing with Pytorch: From zero to GAN](https://jovian.ai/aakashns/collections/deep-learning-with-pytorch) praticing. We study to solve from basic problems (like Linear Regression, MNIST handwriting classification) to advances (data augmentation, GAN (Generative Adversarial Networks),...).
